# d3 Scatterplot
## forked from fcc example
---
- Removed d3.tip library for fcc test requirement (adding data-year attr to tooltip).
- Created own tooltip similar to the example with minor css tweak.
- Added more seconds to the y-axis upper range so that dots will not touch the bottom axis.
- Some style changes.
- Fixed d3.json to use Promise.then() instead of callback.
